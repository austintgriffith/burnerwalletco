      This was SERIOUSLY fire af. What an amazing implementation, extremely smooth onboarding, and it actually worked. Can we do things like this more please? @austingriffith you rock.

      Hat tip to @austingriffith and the Burner Wallet at @EthereumDenver! Quick calculation: $38,432.56 was spent on food trucks across 4,405 meals with a total tx cost for the event at $.20 (!) For tradition CC with ~2% tx fee, this would've instead been ~$800 in fees. 4000X ratio!

      Devs like Austin Griffith are returning to the basics everyday value transfer with innovations like the burner wallet... ...and chugging a beer nearly as quickly as he can send value at very little cost across the globe.

      The #ETHDenver lunch truck experience was awesome. Mobile web-based wallet that I used to scan my lunch token with to load Buff-dai. Once loaded I can scan a QR code at a food truck to pay for my (very delicious) lunch.  A simple #UX

      If you are still sceptical about crypto at this point, just picture these stats at a global scale
